# Week 1

This is the Week 1 set of [projects](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/1/) to complete for the CS50x course.

## A few points of note:

In the CS50x course they have provided their own `<cs50.h>` library to make it easier to get user input in various forms using custom functions like get_string which removes the bariers to getting strings from the somewhat overwhelming way of having to obtain this manually (for those new to programming). In order to minimise getting familiar with syntactic sugar functions I have opted to forgo this in favor of more standard C functions, using scanf instead. 

I will continue with this trend into other projects moving forward.
