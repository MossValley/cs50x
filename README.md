# Harvard CS50x

This is a collection of the projects from Harvard's CS50x Course provided online for free.

In the course itself they use VSCode in an online docker container environment, which provides the same exprience as native VSCode but without the hassle of installing it on you local computer, giving everyone the same basic setup and layout, reducing the barriers to getting up and coding. As I already have my computer set up opted to do these exercises natively instead.
