# Harvard CS50x 2022

This is a collection of the projects from [Harvard's CS50x Course 2022](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0): Introduction to computer science. At the time of completing this course provided online for free online.

## Notes

In the course itself they use VSCode in an online docker container environment, which provides the same exprience as native VSCode but without the hassle of installing it on you local computer, giving everyone the same basic setup and layout, reducing the barriers to getting up and coding. As I already have my computer set up opted to do these exercises natively instead.
